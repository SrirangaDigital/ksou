		<h1 class="level1-title" epub:type="title">SUMMERY OF COMMITTEES RECOMMENDATIONS</h1> 
		<p class="text-center"><strong>PUBLIC SERVICE</strong></p>
		<p>1. Within a period of not more than seven years, not less than half of the higher, and two thirds of the lower appointments in each grade of the service and so far as possible in each office, are to be held by members of communities other than the Brahmin community, preference being given to duly qualified candidates of the depressed classes when such are available. (Para 9)</p>
		<p>2. The right course to ensure the larger employment in the public service of persons belonging to backward communities is to take the existing proportion of Brahmins to other communities in each grade of appointments together with the percentage of those communities to the total numbers of appointments in each grade and reserve as many appointments in that grade as may be necessary to secure a progressive reduction of inequality in each year and vary it each year according to circumstances in order to attain the goal which has been recommended above. (Para 11).</p>
		<p>(Messrs. Srikantesvara Iyer and Ranga Iyengar disagree) Do do</p>
		<p class="text-center"><strong>EDUCATION.</strong></p>
		<p class="text-center"><strong>Primary Education - (among depressed classes).</strong></p>
		<p>(1) A system of special Panchama schools with teachers drawn from the Panchamas, and a special inspectorate seems to be necessary. The Head of the Education department and the supervising agency generally should be selected with reference to their sympathies and general attitude towards the depressed classes. (Para 13).</p>
		<p>(2) A large extension of the system of small scholarships or doles will be useful to overcome the reluctance of the parents to spare their children to attend schools which they are unable to do in their present condition. (Para 18).</p>
		<p>(3) We also recommend the establishment in each district of an institution like the Central Panchama Institute in Mysore, with boarding and special facilities for general and industrial education. (Para 13).</p>
		<p class="text-center"><strong>Primary Education - (among other backward classes)</strong></p>
		<p>(4) For the other backward classes, we recommend a wider expansion of primary education by the establishment of more schools with competent and better paid teachers and by the strengthening of the supervising staff. (Para 13). Secondary Education.</p>
		<p>(5) We are anxious to see an early increase in the number of Lower Secondary Schools of the Anglo-Vernacular type. Schools of the purely Vernacular type might well be converted so as to make English a compulsory subject in order to give equal opportunities to the rural as well as the urban population. (Para 14)</p>
		<p>(6) All secondary schools and colleges should be remodeled on a sort of polytechnic basis so that those whose special aptitudes lie in the study of manual arts may be enabled to reach the stages of higher education with the assistance of their special aptitudes, and that proficiency in the studies certified by a diploma or degree might properly serve as a passport to the Government service. (Para 14).</p>
		<p>(7) It is necessary to have a fair proportion of teachers recruited from the backward classes. (Para 15)</p>
		<p>(8) Special or extra allowances to teachers of the backward classes may be given, not less than what is allowed in the case of Malnad service. (Para 15)</p>
		<p>(9) A fair proportion of the inspectors of schools should be of the backward classes and these should also be given similar allowances. (Para 15)</p>
		<p><strong>Scholarships</strong></p>
		<p>(10) The amount of Rs. 85,000, out of the one lakh of rupees granted for students in University Entrance class, High Schools and Secondary Schools is insufficient and require to be doubled at least. (Para 16)</p>
		<p>(11) The special scholarships should not be taken into consideration an having any bearing on the distribution of general scholarships except in so increase to prevent one student from getting two scholarships. (Para 16)</p>
		<p class="text-right"><strong>Mr. Ranga Iyengar<br /> disagree</strong></p>
		<p>(12) For the better distribution of scholarships, we recommend the appointment of representative sub committees consisting of one or two educational officers and those non-officials representing important communities not only for special scholarships but also to allot general scholarships and free studentships in all grades of education including University. (Para 16)</p>
		<p>(13) Two-thirds the number of existing Indian and Foreign scholarships should be reserved for backward classes for the next five years. (Para 16)</p>
		<p>Do do Do do</p>
		<p class="text-center"><strong>HOSTELS</strong></p>
		<p>(14) Hostels should be constructed in all taluk headquarter towns and there should be at least three separate kitchens in all Hostels, two for vegetarians and one for non-vegetarians. (Para 17).</p>
		<p>(15) In Government Hostels, a certain proportion (not less than 50 percent) of seats should be reserved for pupils of backward classes. (Para 17).</p>
		<p>(16) Private or communal hostels should be given the same grants as Government Hostels. (Para 17)</p>
		<p>(17) The claims of backward classes should be satisfied first up to one-half the number of seats available in cuch class or section in all schools and colleges. (Para 17).</p>
		<p>Do do</p>
		<p class="text-center"><strong>MAHOMEDAN EDUCATION</strong></p>
		<p>(18) The number and efficiency of Anglo-Hindustan Schools should be increased. (Para 18) (19) In places where an adequate number of Mahomedan boys is forthcoming to join the schools Hindustani sections may be opened in some Taluk Anglo-Kannada Schools. In others, Hindustani-knowing teachers may be employed on the staff. (Para 18)</p>
		<p class="text-center"><strong>RECRITMENT TO PUBLIC SERVICE</strong></p>
		<p>(1) Government should lay down a policy for each department of the public service and fix the minimum educational qualifications for entry into particular grades of appointments according to the nature of their functions. (Para 20).</p>
		<p>(2) In the case of candidates of the backward classes, the age limit for entry into the service may be raised from 25 to 28 years. (Para 21). Mr. Ranga Iyengar disagree</p>
		<p>(3) All competitive examinations including Munsiffs' examination) should be abolished, and until this is done, a larger number of the appointments in the higher grades should be given to members of the backward communities by nomination. A board of representative officers may be appointed for the selection of candidates instead of the competitive examinations. (Para 22)</p>
		<p>Messrs. Srikantesvara Iyer and Ranga Iyengar disagree</p>
		<p>(4) For non-gazetted appointments, no higher general educational qualifications than S.S.L.C should be prescribed, and Lower Secondary for Shekdars. (Para 23)</p>
		<p>(5) Steps may be taken to bring out equality in the Secretariats in three or five years. (Para 25)</p>
		<p>(6) The administration report of each year should show the proportion of Brahmins to all other classes in each grade of appointment, together with the number of appointments and the percentage of appointments given to members of backward classes to the total number of appointments in each grade showing also how the principle of progressive reduction of the inequality in public service has worked during the particular year. The report may also publish what special facilities for the education of backward classes have been provided and how far they have helped the promotion of even distribution of education in the State. (Para 26).</p>
		<p>(7) A standing committee consisting of official and non-official gentlemen representing the classes for whose benefit the above reforms are introduced should be appointed to watch the administration of the rules. A Member of Council may be the president of the Committee. (Para 26)</p>
		<p>(8) Non-Mysoreans educated in Mysore Schools and Colleges may be admitted to the Mysore services.</p>
		<p>Messrs. Srikantesvara Iyer and Ranga Iyengar disagree</p>
