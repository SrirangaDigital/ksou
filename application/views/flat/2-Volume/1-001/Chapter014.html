				<h3 class="level3-title" epub:type="title">Order No. 13690-91-Edn. 834-28-2, dated 27th June, 1929</h3>
				<p>In the Government Order dated 25th January 1928, referred to above, Government while approving the marginally noted resolution of the informal conference of gentlemen interested in the education of Adi Karnatakas, held on 13th December 1926, directed that the following note be inserted under Rule C III of the Rules of Grant-inaid to Private Hostels issued under the first of the Government Orders read above:</p>
				<p>Resolved that Hostels for Adi Karnatakas on the Grant-in-aid basis be encouraged, the usual grant allowed under Grant-in-aid Rules with half the cost of boarding not exceeding Rs. 3 per boy being given.</p>
				<p>"Note-In the case of Hostels intended for Adi Karnataka and Adi Dravida pupils, one half of the establishment and boarding charges subject to a maximum of Rs. 3 per boarder per mensem, will be given in addition to the existing concessions". this concession will be force for three years.</p>
				<p>Under Rule C III of the Rules of Grant- in- aid to private Hostels issued under Government order dated 1st June 1922, the grant in the case of hostels attached to training Institutions and Hostels intended for girls and pupils of the Depressed Classes is increased up to the full cost of establishment and rent.</p>
				<p>The Director of Public Instruction points out that the note to Rule C III of Government Order dated 1st June 1922 referred to above, does not agree in full with the resolution of the informal conference as it sanctions only half the charges (subject to a maximum of Rs. 3 per boarder) on account of the establishment and boarding together.</p>
				<p>He therefore requests that the resolution of the informal conference may be approved in toto and that the words "the establishment "occurring in Note to government Order dated 25th January 1928, may be elected.</p>
				<p>Government is pleased to sanction the proposal of the Director of Public Instruction. the words "establishment and "occurring in the above mentioned note will be deleted.</p>

				<p>The memorialists represent that it is the people of the Bilimagga Community that are entitled to be termed 'Kuruhina Setties', and that if, as is contemplated in the Government Order read above, all members of the Koramar or Korachar Community be allowed to return themselves as Kuruhina Setties, it is likely to result in a mistaken identity of the communities in question, besides bringing down the Bilimagga people to the level of the Korachars and Koramars who come under the purview of the Criminal tribes Regulation. On a careful consideration of the subject, Government is pleased to direct that the term 'Kuruhina Setties' be confined to the Bilimagga Community.</p>
