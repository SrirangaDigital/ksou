				<p>Government consider it desirable to constitute a small Committee for each Taluk for helping the Adikarnatakas, as conformity with the principles and general directions laid down by the Central Committee. They are accordingly pleased to direct the constitution of a Committee for each Taluk consisting of two or three Adikarnatakas of the Taluk and one or two others interested in this branch of social work with the Amildar as Chairman. The Committee may meet once a month and submit a report to the Chairman of the Central Committee through the Deputy Commissioners.</p>

					<li>The Revenue Commissioner states that according to the directions contained in the Government Order read above, the maximum number of members to the Taluk Committees will be six, including the Chairman (Vis., Amildar), of whom three must be Adikarnatakas and two others interested in this branch of social work who need not necessarily belong to Depressed Classes. He considers that it is desirable to make these committees quite representative by nominating members of other Depressed Classes, such as Banajars, Voddars, etc., also and recommends, therefore, that the strength of these committees may be increased to eight so that it may be possible to give a fair representation to all Depressed Classes on the Committee.</li>
					<li>Government agree with the Revenue Commissioner and are pleased to direct that the number of members of the Committees be fixed at not less than six and not more than eight, so that representatives of the Banjar and Voddar Communities may be nominated as members wherever such representation is necessary.</li>

					<li>The resolutions passed at a joint meeting of the Adikarnataka and Adi-Jambava Associations held on 15th September 1940, praying that the qualifications prescribed for candidature to the Legislative Council may be reduced in the case of the depressed classes to Rs. 4 under village panchayet and municipal taxes and Rs. 20 under land revenue.</li>
					<li>Representation dated 15th October 1940, from Mr. R. Chennigaramaiah, praying that the taxpaying qualifications for candidature may be reduced in the case of the depressed classes as suggested in the resolutions read above, that in place of the cumulative system of voting, the method of election recommended by the Reforms Committee may be adopted for the depressed class seats in the Representative Assembly and the Legislative Council and that a depressed class elector may be allowed to stand as a candidate for any depressed class seat in the Legislative Council.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>ORDER No.RL.1673-83-R.A.42-40-1, DATED BANGALORE, THE 16th DECEMBER 1940.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Under the Legislative Council Rules, the tax-paying qualifications for candidature have fixed twice as high as those prescribed for the vote, namely, assessment to Rs. 10 under village panchayet and municipal taxes and Rs. 50 under land revenue. Having regard to the general economic level of the Depressed classes, Government consider that these qualifications are very high, and that a community whose backwardness and want of education necessitated a reduction in the franchise qualifications may not be able to offer candidates in sufficient numbers possessing such high qualifications for filling the four seats reserved for the depressed classes in the Legislative Council. They consider that a reduction of the qualifications is necessary in the circumstances and have been pleased to direct that Rule 22(A) may be added to the Legislative Council Rules fixing the qualifications at one-half the rates fixed for candidates not belonging to the depressed classes namely, Rs.5 under village panchayet and municipal taxes and Rs.25 under land revenue.</li>
					<li>It is also considered desirable to change the method of election to the seats reserved for the Depressed classes in the Representative Assembly and the Legislative Council. Rules 116 and 96 of the Representative Assembly Rules and the Legislative Council Rules, respectively, provide for the cumulative system of voting in all multimember constituencies. It has been urged that even this system would not secure the election to the depressed class seats of persons representing the interests of the depressed classes or reflecting the opinion of that community, and that it is possible under the cumulative system of voting for a candidate to be returned mainly by the strength of the caste Hindu community. Government consider this to be a legitimate grievance and are accordingly pleased to direct the adoption for the depressed class seats of the method of election recommended by the Reforms Committee in paragraph 168 of their report, which ensures that due weight is given to the depressed class vote when it reaches a prescribed percentage. <br />Government are further pleased to direct that the restriction that a person should stand as a candidate for the Legislative Council only in a constituency in which he is registered as an elector may be removed in the case of the depressed classes.</li>
