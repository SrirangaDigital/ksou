				<p>the Report on Public Instruction in Mysore for the year 192930, submitted by the Director of Public Instruction, with his letter No. L. Dis. 2202-158 of 30-31, dated 25th October 1930.</p>
				<p>Order No. E. 1214-73-Edn. 189-30-5, dated 23rd April, 1931 Full report from P 160 to P 166</p>
				<p>16. Scholarships and Endowments:- the total amount spent on scholarships extending those, viz. the University, was Rs.1,72,708 of which a sum of Rs.1,16,090 was for phylim, Backward and Depressed ....... scholarships. In addition, a sum of Rs.11,514 -3-0 was spent in scholarships and .......... from proceeds of endorsements.</p>
				<p>Education of the Backward and the Depressed Classes.- Special encouragement was given as usual to the children of these classes by the award of scholarships (see below, Para 16). Clothing was also supplied to girls of the Depressed Classes who were not awarded scholarships and Government sanctioned in the case of all pupils of these classes, the continuance of the exemption from payment of tuition, examination and medical examination fees. Further, a liberal system of grant-in-aid for hostels for Adikarnataka boys has been sanctioned and the concessions under this system have also been extended to hostels for Banjar (Lambani) students. the practice of maintaining separate schools for the children of the Depressed Classes is being steadily discouraged and a large number of such schools have already been amalgamated with general schools. there were 636 separate schools with a strength of 17,090 (including 2,539 girls) during the year, as against 641 schools with 17,315 pupils (including 2,946 girls) in the previous year. On the other hand 4,680 depressed class pupils were studying in general schools, 203 of them being in the high school classes, as against 4,268 on the year previous.</p>
